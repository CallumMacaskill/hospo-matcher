# Midpoint
Midpoint helps you meet in the middle by finding the central location between you and your friends.

It can be tricky figuring out where to meet up when everyone is coming from different locations. Meetups during lunch at work or big weekend get-togethers are all easier with Midpoint.

Implemented as a vanilla JS website, users can find their meetup location themselves by entering all locations or sharing a session link with friends.

The code is not perfect, just what's good enough for sharing a weekend project with friends!
